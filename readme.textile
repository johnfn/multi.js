h1. multi.js

A framework to make coding multiplayer JS games with "node":http://nodejs.org/ easier.

h2. the big idea

Like most multiplayer apps, there are two sides to this one: the server and the client. multi.js takes care of synchronization between client and server, so you can work on logic.

h3. server

The Multi object on the server has two public functions.

h4. init

To get the multi.js server up and running:

@Multi.init(server)@

where @server@ is the server object running in node.js.

h4. addEvent

The server is where you code the core game logic. multi.js sends out events when it thinks that something important has happened. There are only two events!

* @newuser@ - Triggered when a new user connects.

Arguments: ID, a unique ID tied to the user that just joined.

Sample use:

bc. function newUserEvent(ID){
    console.log("A new user has joined, with ID " + ID);
}
Multi.addEvent("newuser", newUserEvent);


p. * @input@ - Triggered when a user sends input - either a keydown or mousedown event.

Arguments: input, an object representing which keys or buttons have been pressed. *TODO* I am going to turn this into more natural keydown and mousedown events.

Sample use:

bc. function inputEvent(input){
    console.log("A user has made some sort of input.")
    console.log(input);
}
Multi.addEvent("input", inputEvent);

h3. client

On the client side, most of the work is done for you.
