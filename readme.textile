h1. multi.js

A framework to make coding multiplayer JS games with "node":http://nodejs.org/ easier.

h2. the big idea

Like most multiplayer apps, there are two sides to this one: the server and the client. multi.js takes care of synchronization between client and server, so you can work on logic.

h3. server

To get the multi.js server up and running:

@Multi.init(server)@

where @server@ is the server object running in node.js.



The server is where you code the core game logic. multi.js sends out events when it thinks that something important has happened. So far, there are only two.

@newuser@ - Triggered when a new user connects.

@input@ - Triggered when a user sends input - either a keydown, or a mousedown event.

You can wire up event handlers like so:

@Multi.addEvent("newuser", newUserHandler);


h3. client

On the client side, most of the work is done for you.
